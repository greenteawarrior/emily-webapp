============

[udacity web development] webdev exercises and blog project 

built with the python SDK for google app engine!


In the root folder, each python script can be run as its own (i.e.adjust the setting for scriptname.app in the .yaml file)

main.py combines exercises/webpages so all of the projects/exercises can be accessed at once when you run the devserver.
